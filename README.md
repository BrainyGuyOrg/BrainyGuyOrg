I have had an interest in software performance for a long time.
I am currently working on [BrainyGuy Logger](https://github.com/BrainyGuyOrg/logger).
I would love to get feedback on this project.

I am currently learning more about CPU performance counters and the Linux Perf subsystem.

I have been getting paid to write computer software since 1981.
My strongest programming language is C++, with C and many others close seconds.
I currently live in sunny California.
